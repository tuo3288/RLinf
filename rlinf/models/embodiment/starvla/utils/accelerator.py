"""Accelerator-neutral autocast and action distribution for starVLA.

starVLA upstream targets CUDA. On other accelerators (Ascend NPU via
``torch_npu``, Intel XPU, ...) a ``"cuda"`` autocast silently does nothing and
some dtypes it leaves in place have no kernel, so the starVLA paths build their
autocast and policy distribution through these helpers.

            autocast without converting existing tensors.

    ``mean`` inherits the backbone dtype (bfloat16 when autocast did not upcast
    it) and ``std`` inherits the policy parameter dtype. Sampling from a
    bfloat16 ``Normal`` calls ``torch.normal(mean, std)``, which has no
    bfloat16 kernel on Ascend ("tensor mean not implemented for DT_BFLOAT16"),
    so both are cast up front. Downstream log-probs, entropies and values are
    consumed as float32 anyway, so this costs nothing on CUDA.

    Args:
        mean: Distribution location, any floating dtype.
        std: Distribution scale, broadcastable against ``mean``.

    Returns:
        The float32 ``Normal`` over the (broadcast) action shape.
